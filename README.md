# Determining the orientation of well plates

To run inferences on images, first download the weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EYLgNjFggiPMpnEt2_KfuJKPfhzkAAkc/view?usp=sharing). Then, run the inference.py script as follows: `inference.py --img_path=<path_to_your_image> --weights_path=<path_to_your_weights>`. The model has been trained to achieve around 83-85% accuracy on plate well images.
